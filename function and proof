;; THE PROOF

(thm (implies (and (lorp ls) (descending ls))
  (descending-powerset ls)))
  
;; lemmas we will need!

Lemma cons-descending-list
;; if you cons an element that is greater than descending list, get a descending list
(implies (and (rationalp n) (lorp ls) (descending ls) (> n (car ls)))
         (descending (cons n ls)))

Lemma descending-powerset
(implies (and (lorp ls) (descending ls) (lolorp ps) (descending-powerset ps))
              (descending-powerset (cons ls ps)))

Lemma for descending-add-rat
(implies (and (rationalp n) (lolorp ls) (descending-powerset ls))
        (descending-powerset (add-rat n ls)))

Lemma greater-equal-subset:
(implies (and (lorp ls) (descending ls))
   (or (= (len2 (car (powerset ls))) (len2 (car (cdr (powerset ls))))) 
         (> (len2 (car (powerset ls))) (len2 (car (cdr (powerset ls))))) ))

;; if car powerset ls length= car cdr powerset ls , then we go to the second case
;; 1 case where they are equal -> lemma about length
;; 2 case where they aren't equal -> lemma about length not equal
