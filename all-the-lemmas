Lemma descending-list
;; Proves that if we cons a rational greater than the first item in the list to a descending list, the list will be descending
(implies (and (rationalp n) (lorp ls) (descending ls) (> n (car ls)))
         (descending (cons n ls)))

Lemma descending-powerset-pf
;; Proves that if we cons a descending list (greater than first list) to a descending powerset, still have descending powerset
(implies (and (lorp ls) (descending ls) (lolorp ps) (descending-powerset ps))
              (descending-powerset (cons ls ps)))))

Lemma descending-add-rat
;; Proves that add-rat returns a new descending powerset (with items of the same length*)
(implies (and (natp n) (lolorp ls) (descending-powerset ls))
        (descending-powerset (add-rat n ls)))
        
; * need to account for this in lemma
