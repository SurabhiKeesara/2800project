Main proof:

(thm (implies (and (lorp ls) 
                   (consp ls) ;;could be (rationalp (car ls))
                   (descending ls) 
                   (descending-powerset (powerset (cons (car ls) (cdr ls)))))
              (descending-powerset (powerset-cons (car ls) (powerset (cdr ls)))))
     :hints (("Goal" :use descending-pw-pwcons)))
