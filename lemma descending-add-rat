Lemma for descending-add-rat
(implies (and (rationalp n) (lolorp ls) (descending-powerset ls))
        (descending-powerset (add-rat n ls)))

This will be an inductive proof on (add-rat n ls) but we can begin by looking at the inductive case.

(implies (and (rationalp n) (lolorp (cdr ls)) (> n (car (car ls))) (descending-powerset (cdr ls)))
        (descending-powerset (add-rat n (cdr ls))))

Context:
C1. (rationalp n)
C2. (lolorp (cdr ls))
C3. (> n (car (car ls)))

Derived:
D1. (descending-powerset (add-rat n (cdr ls)))
D2. (descending (cons n (car ls))) {lemma cons-descending-list ((n n) (ls ls))}

Goal:
(descending-powerset (add-rat n ls))

Proof:
(add-rat n ls)
= {Def add-rat, C3}
(cons (cons n (car ls)) (add-rat n (cdr ls)))
= {D2, D1, lemma descending-powerset ( (ls (cons n (car ls))) (ps (add-rat n (cdr ls))) )  }
(descending-powerset (cons (cons n (car ls)) (add-rat n (cdr ls))))
= {Def add-rat}
(descending-powerset (add-rat n ls))
