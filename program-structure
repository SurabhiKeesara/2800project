The structure of our project:

FUNCTIONS
- descendingp (lor -> bool): 
    - checks to see if the given list of rationals is in descendingp order
- compare-lists (lor lor -> bool):
    - checks the 2 given lists and makes sure they are in the right order 
- descending-powersetp (lolor --> bool):
    - checks if the given lolor is a descendingp powerset
- gte-allp (lor -> bool):
    - checks if the rational is greater than all the values in the list of rationals
- add-rat (rational lolor -> lolor): 
    - adds the given rational to the front of every list in the lolor if it is greater than the first 
      of each list in the lolor
- merge-sort (lolor lolor -> lolor)
    - function to take in an element and powerset to build new powerset
- powerset (lor -> lolor):
    - creates the powerset of the given list of rationals
- powerset-cons (rational lolor -> lolor):
    - creates a powerset with the given rational
- also includes all checker tests for these functions

PROOFS
- desc-add-rat: shows that if powerset of a list is a descending powerset, add-rat of a rational 
that's greater than the car of the list is also a descending-powerset
    - Proven with: Pen-and-paper proof (in ACL2S is a skip-proof)
    - Used by: expand-powerset
- expand-merge-sort: shows that if 2 lolor are descending-powersets, then them merged 
is also a descending powerset
    - Proven with: N/A (in ACL2S is a skip-proof)
    - Used by: expand-powerset
- expand-powerset: shows that expanded powerset-cons is a descending-powerset when powerset is 
a descending powerset
    - Proven with: desc-add-rat, expand-merge-sort
    - Used by: pw-cons-descending
- pw-cons-descending: shows that if powerset of a list is a descending powerset, 
then powerset-cons of a rational greater than the first of the list is also a descending powerset
    - Proven with: expand-powerset
    - Used by: main conjecture
- MAIN CONJECTURE: Shows that using our powerset function when given a descending list,
we get an output with 2 properties shown in descending-powersetp
    - Proven with: pw-cons-descending
